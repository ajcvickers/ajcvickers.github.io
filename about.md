Welcome to my blog!

I'm Arthur and this is my little place on the web where I write about stuff that interests me.
Which pretty much means Entity Framework and other software stuff!

This is what I wrote in 2011 when I started blogging:

> Sometimes I feel like sharing thoughts about the Entity Framework, my team, Microsoft, or coding in general. This blog is a place to put those thoughts.

> A bit about me: Iâ€™m a developer on the Entity Framework team at Microsoft. I joined the team just after the first (.NET 3.5sp1) version of EF was completed. For EF 4.0 I worked mostly on POCO support and FK associations, with a bunch of other things thrown in. Since we wrapped up work on EF4 I have been primarily involved in the DbContext API and Code First.

It's 2020 and I'm now the Engineering Manager for Entity Framework, but otherwise not much has changed.

Thanks for reading!<br>
