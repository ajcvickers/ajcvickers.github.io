Sometimes I feel like sharing thoughts about the Entity Framework, my team, Microsoft, or coding in general.
This blog is a place to put those thoughts.

A bit about me: I'm ~~a developer on~~ the engineering manager for the Entity Framework team at Microsoft.

This is what I wrote in 2011:

For EF 4.0 I worked mostly on POCO support and FK associations, with a bunch of other things thrown in.
Since we wrapped up work on EF4Â I have been primarily involved in the DbContext API and Code First.

Not much has changed. :smilecat:

Thanks for reading!
