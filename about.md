Sometimes I feel like sharing thoughts about the Entity Framework, my team, Microsoft, or coding in general.
This blog is a place to put those thoughts.

A bit about me: Iâ€™m ~~a developer~~ the engineering manager for Entity Framework at Microsoft.

This is what I wrote when I originally started this blog:

> I joined the team just after the first (.NET 3.5sp1) version of EF was completed.
For EF 4.0 I worked mostly on POCO support and FK associations, with a bunch of other things thrown in.
Since we wrapped up work on EF4 I have been primarily involved in the DbContext API and Code First.

I still work on DbContext. Only now in [EF Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore).

Thanks for reading!
