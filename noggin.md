# Use Your Noggin!

<h2 style="text-align:center">You just read something on the Internet!<sup><span style="font-size: x-small">(<a href="#footnote-1">1</a>)</span></sup></h2>

<h2 style="text-align:center">But can you trust it?</h2>

So ask yourself...
* Who wrote it?
* Where are you reading it?
* When was it written?

---

## Author

What do you know about the author?

* Do they know what they are talking about?
* What do you know about their biases?
* What are they hoping to get out of this?

---

<h2>Website</h2>

It might be hard to learn about individual authors.
So in addition look at the website serving the content.

* What motivates the website to serve this content?
* Does a company/organization/agency hold a stake that could bias this content?
* Does the website generally provide reliable information?

---

## Date

The information might have been complete, accurate, and unbiased<sup><span style="font-size: x-small">([2](#footnote-2))</span></sup> when it was written.
But if this was a long time<sup><span style="font-size: x-small">([3](#footnote-3))</span></sup> ago, then:

* None of it may be relevant!
* All of it may be relevant!
* Probably some of it is relevant.

---

## So what can you do?

Use your noggin!

* Research the author and the website.
* Validate information from multiple reliable sources.
* Make sure the information is still relevant today.

The Internet is a great resource.

But make sure you can trust what you are reading.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Don't be a plonker.</h2>

### Footnotes

<div style="font-size: small">

<a name="footnote-1"></a>
<sup>(1)</sup> Actually, not just the Internet.
Just because somebody wrote something in a book doesn't mean it can be trusted.

<a name="footnote-2"></a>
<sup>(2)</sup> Unbiased? [No](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype).

<a name="footnote-3"></a>
<sup>(3)</sup> What is a long time?
Depends on the content.
In software, five years is definitely a long time.
