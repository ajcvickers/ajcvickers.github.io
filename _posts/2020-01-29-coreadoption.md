# EF Core adoption is very healthy

I commonly see feedback from people assuming that EF Core is not heavily used. This isn't true. The internal usage numbers are <em>very</em> healthy. The number of people moving from previous EF Core releases to 3.1 is also very healthy. I'm not going to post these numbers on my personal blog because, basically, I don't want to get fired! However, the trends are also visible in public data--notably, NuGet package downloads.

At the time of writing, <a href="https://nugettrends.com/packages?months=24&amp;ids=Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore&amp;ids=EntityFramework&amp;ids=Dapper&amp;ids=NHibernate">NuGet Trends</a> is returning the following data:

Now, NuGet package downloads are notoriously hard to interpret. However, I think the trend here is pretty clear.

I should point out that I don't intend from showing this that people drop one technology and use another. As I said in my <a href="https://blog.oneunicorn.com/2020/01/29/coreor6/">previous post</a>, please use what works best for you.

I think it's also true that Microsoft packages have an advantage. Fully embracing the .NET ecosystem is something I push for internally. It's much better now than it was 10 years ago, but there is still room for improvement.

Anyway, as I said, I really just want to point out that EF Core adoption is very healthy and growing very fast.
