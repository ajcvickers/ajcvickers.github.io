Sometimes I feel like sharing thoughts about the Entity Framework, my team, Microsoft, or coding in general. This blog is a place to put those thoughts.

A bit about me: I'm a developer on the Entity Framework team at Microsoft. I joined the team just after the first (.NET 3.5sp1) version of EF was completed. For EF 4.0 I worked mostly on POCO support and FK associations, with a bunch of other things thrown in. Since we wrapped up work on EF4Â I have been primarily involved in the DbContext API and Code First.
