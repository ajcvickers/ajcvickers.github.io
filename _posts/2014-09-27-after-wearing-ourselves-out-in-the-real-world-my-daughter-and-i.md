Today, after wearing ourselves out in the real world, my daughter and I have paddled down the Anduin and through the Argonath, floated in space above the Earth, flown through the Solar System and marveled at the beauty of Saturn's rings, watched some of The Lego Movie in 3D on a giant theater screen, caused asteroids to explode by staring at them, shot paper balls around a classroom and played a Game Boy under the desk, until the game came out of the Game Boy and filled the classroom, sat in a cafe in Paris as a robot, enjoyed butterflies fluttering around us and petals floating softly from above, ridden a roller coaster through a lava factory, and flown inside our own Minecraft worlds. This is just the beginning. Thank you Oculus. Everything is awesome.
