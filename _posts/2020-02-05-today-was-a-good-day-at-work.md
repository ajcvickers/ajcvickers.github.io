No, this post isn't about installing Linux.

And I didn't write any code today.

I was working with people all day.
This isn't easy for me, but more and more it feels both rewarding and worthwhile.

### » Me

I'm a geek, a dork, a clumsy introvert.
Meeting new people is hard for me.

But I strongly believe that effective collaboration results in better software.
And happier people.<sup>([1](#footnote-1))</sup>

One of my most important jobs as a manager is to facilitate and encourage effective collaboration.
Today I think I achieved that, which made it a good day.

### » My day

The EF team meets for a couple of hours every Wednesday morning for a "Design Meeting".
It went well--good humored, productive, and with digressions about other stuff going on around us.
(I tell people about what I hear in "manager meetings" as much as I can. As a non-manager, being kept in the dark was very frustrating.)

Half way through the design meeting a prospective new team member was able to drop in.
I felt awkward getting people to introduce themselves.
But I tried hard to keep it upbeat, lighthearted, and enthusiastic.
It went well.
I was a socially awkward dork, but a happy, enthusiastic, and hopefully engaging one.

Several meetings later I was in a similar situation again; meeting new people.<sup>([2](#footnote-2))</sup>
This time it was the first in a new sync I setup with the SqlClient team.
Again, I felt I was quite clumsy in kicking off the meeting and doing introductions.
I talked quite a bit at the beginning trying to get things going.
But by the end people seemed at their ease and were engaging in interactive discussions.

I also remembered to thank the SqlClient team for the good job they are doing managing their GitHub repo.
(It's not that I had to remember to be thankful.
But remembering to _tell people_ you are thankful when appropriate is important.)
It went well.

### » I'm medicated

I've been taking antianxiety medication for three years now.
It took me until my 40s to realize that I didn't have to live with the level of social anxiety I was accustomed to.

I'm not saying medication is the right path for everyone.
But I don't think I could be a manager without it.
Days like today would have been too stressful for me to cope.

Instead I was able to bring people together.
And that made it a good day.
